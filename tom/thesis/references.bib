abstract = {Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go [Gelly et al., 2006]. Their efficient exploration of the tree enables to return rapidly a good value, and improve precision if more time is provided. The UCT algorithm [Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006], a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) [Auer et al. 2002], is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is ''over-optimistic'' in some sense, leading to a worst-case regret that may be very poor. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially in the horizon depth is analyzed. We then consider Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce and analyze a Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees (BAST) which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient ''cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree expansion which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, only the optimal branches are indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a continuous function, given noisy values.},

@article{Kaelbling1998,
abstract = {In this paper, we bring techniques from operations research to bear on the problem of choosing optimal actions in partially observable stochastic domains. We begin by introducing the theory of Markov decision processes (MDPs) and partially observable MDPs (POMDPs). We then outline a novel algorithm for solving POMDPs off line and show how, in some cases, a finite-memory controller can be extracted from the solution to a POMDP. We conclude with a discussion of how our approach relates to previous work, the complexity of finding exact solutions to POMDPs, and of some possibilities for finding approximate solutions. Consider the problem of a robot navigating in a large office building. The robot can move from hallway intersection to intersection and can make local observations of its world. Its actions are not completely reliable, however. Sometimes, when it intends to move, it stays where it is or goes too far; sometimes, when it intends to turn, it overshoots. It has similar problems with observation. Sometimes a corridor looks like a corner; sometimes a T-junction looks like an L-junction. How can such an error-plagued robot navigate, even given a map of the corridors? PII: S 0 0 0 4 -3 7 0 2 (9 8) 0 0 0 2 3 -X 100 L.P. Kaelbling et al. / Artificial Intelligence 101 (1998) 99–134 In general, the robot will have to remember something about its history of actions and observations and use this information, together with its knowledge of the underlying dynamics of the world (the map and other information), to maintain an estimate of its location. Many engineering applications follow this approach, using methods like the Kalman filter [26] to maintain a running estimate of the robot's spatial uncertainty, expressed as an ellipsoid or normal distribution in Cartesian space. This approach will not do for our robot, though. Its uncertainty may be discrete: it might be almost certain that it is in the north-east corner of either the fourth or the seventh floors, though it admits a chance that it is on the fifth floor, as well. Then, given an uncertain estimate of its location, the robot has to decide what actions to take. In some cases, it might be sufficient to ignore its uncertainty and take actions that would be appropriate for the most likely location. In other cases, it might be better for the robot to take actions for the purpose of gathering information, such as searching for a landmark or reading signs on the wall. In general, it will take actions that fulfill both purposes simultaneously.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning policies face the exploration versus exploitation dilemma, i.e. the search for a balance between exploring the environment to find profitable actions while taking the empirically best action as often as possible. A popular measure of a policy's success in addressing this dilemma is the regret, that is the loss due to the fact that the globally optimal policy is not followed all the times. One of the simplest examples of the exploration/exploitation dilemma is the multi-armed bandit problem. Lai and Robbins were the first ones to show that the regret for this problem has to grow at least logarithmically in the number of plays. Since then, policies which asymptotically achieve this regret have been devised by Lai and Robbins and many others. In this work we show that the optimal logarithmic regret is also achievable uniformly over time, with simple and efficient policies, and for all reward distributions with bounded support.},

abstract = {abstract The ancient oriental game of Go has long been considered a grand challenge for artificial intelligence. For decades, computer Go has defied the classical methods in game tree search that worked so successfully for chess and checkers. However, recent play in computer Go has been transformed by a new paradigm for tree search based on Monte-Carlo methods. Programs based on Monte-Carlo tree search now play at human-master levels and are beginning to challenge top professional players. In this paper, we describe the lead-ing algorithms for Monte-Carlo tree search and explain how they have advanced the state of the art in computer Go. 1. inTRoDucTion Sequential decision making has been studied in a num-ber of fields, ranging from optimal control through opera-tions research to artificial intelligence (AI). The challenge of sequential decision making is to select actions that maxi-mize some long-term objective (e.g., winning a game), when the consequences of those actions may not be revealed for many steps. In this paper, we focus on a new approach to sequential decision making that was developed recently in the context of two-player games. Classic two-player games are excellent test beds for AI. They provide closed micro-worlds with simple rules that have been selected and refined over hundreds or thousands of years to challenge human players. They also provide clear benchmarks of performance both between different pro-grams and against human intelligence. In two-player games such as chess, checkers, othello, and backgammon, human levels of performance have been exceeded by programs that combine brute force tree-search with human knowledge or reinforcement learning.},
